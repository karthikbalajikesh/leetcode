# Arrays

Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory holding items of the same data type. They are extremely powerful as they have constant access to any element, if we have the index of that element.


## Time complexity for common applications

### Adding at the end
If memory is already allocated, it is O(1)

### Removing at the end
O(1)

### Adding or Removing  at the front or middle
O(n) as we need to move elements to the left or right
